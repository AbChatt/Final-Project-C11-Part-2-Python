Answer The Following Questions:

Visualization:
---------------

1. Do you expect logistic regression to perform well on generic_1?   Why or why not?
Yes we can draw linear decision boundaries between each class that completely encompass the members of the class with no outliers

2. Do you expect it to do well on generic_2?  Why or why not?
No, because the decision boundaries between each class are elipsoidal in nature. Logistic regression works well on linear decision boundaries

3. Why canâ€™t we directly visualize the orchid dataset?
We cannot plot 4 dimensional inputs onto a graph  

4. Briefly specify some ways that you might be able visualize it to some extent?
- Reduce dimensionality of data using PCA by mapping to a lower subspace and then plot data
- Split measurements into sepal data and petal data and make 2 plots of 2D inputs


Final Analysis:
---------------

1. Orchid dataset: Does logistic regression prform well on this dataset? 
No it performs badly as training and validation accuracy are less than 50%

2. What are the training and validation accuracies for the Orchid dataset, and do they appear reasonable?  Explain your answer.
My training and validation accuracies are 33%. It seems reasonable as the decision boundaries are not linear for this dataset

3. Generic datasets: Does logistic regression do well on these two datasets? Do the actual results agreewith your initial hypotheses?
No, logistic regression does not work well on these 2 datasets. However, in line with my hypothesis, generic 2 performs better
